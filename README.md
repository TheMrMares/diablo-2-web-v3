# Diablo II Web (game)

## About

That's my unique project and/or idea to create Diablo II in web, with javascript mostly.

## Technology

Im going to use only raw javascript, with ES6 sometimes, so it's going to be a little archaic but we will see what am I able to create. Also there will be no additional libraries or frameworks. I use only webpack because had to migrate for it in case of technic issues.

## Game made with

How I built my game? Here you are: 

* No project templates
* Raw and simple javascript
* No libraries and any extensions
* Webpack
